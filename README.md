## I'm Cyrille Candelaria      ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა

🔭 Ever since I was a young kid, I’ve always wanted to become a doctor. It is after watching Grey’s Anatomy that I’ve decided that I want to be a cardiologist! However, I am also interested in technology. I want to combine my passion in both to help create a better world. Tech and healthcare go hand-in-hand, and it is something that will only get bigger from now. I hope to be a part of the journey!
